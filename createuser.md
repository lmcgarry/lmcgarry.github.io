## Creating a user account

On the user management page of your ownCloud Web User Interface, follow these steps to create a new user:

1. On the user management default page, specify the user's login name and initial password (cannot be 0).

**Note**: User's login name can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.) and at signs (@).
2. If required, select the group to which you want to assign this user from the drop-down list.
3. Click **Create**.

After creating the user, you can enter their **Full Name** if it is different than the user login name, or leave it for the user to complete. Additionally, if the option **Send email to new user** is enabled, you can also specify the new userâ€™s email address, and an email is automatically sent them with their new login information. You can edit the default email template on your Admin page (see [Email Configuration](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/configuration/server/email_configuration.html)).
